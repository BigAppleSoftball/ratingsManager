Softball players and leathermen have always hung out together at this legendary leather/levi bar. Friendly competition on the softball field both locally and across the country became a means by which this remote outpost (it used be located on 21st street and the West Side Highway) could bridge the cultural gap between the Eagle and the rest of the gay community.The Eagle has been deeply involved in the community hosting numerous fundraisers and raising 100's of thousands of dollars over the years for charitable organizations like GMHC, Callen-Lorde, the Anti-Violence Project and many many others.</p>
<p>We still play softball in the upper division of the BASL, we still have really hot patrons, we still have great DJ's, we still raise money for our community, but we moved 10 years ago to a 2 story building on 28th street between 10th &amp; 11th Avenues, five times the size of the original Eagle. In the summer our large roofdeck bar is open so you can enjoy the warm sunshine while drinking your ice cold beer and hanging with your friends.</p>
<p>We also have many themed parties and events so to keep up to date with what's going on at the Eagle you can either subscribe to our free weekly newsletter at www.eaglenyc.com or join us on Facebook at TheEagleNYC or do both.</p>",13,7,0,0.65,20,1,191,147,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,"2010-04-25 15:54:00",,1,,"1","1","1","1",,
