    %p  As a member of NAGAAA it is our duty and responsibility to rate all our league players and report these ratings, when applicable, to NAGAAA. The purpose of the ratings is to ensure all players are eligible to play in the appropriate NAGAAA division (A, B, C or D) should they attend a NAGAAA World Series or any other sanctioned NAGAAA slow-pitch, softball tournament. The ratings are not intended to forcibly move players into a higher division. Proper ratings protect players and teams - from penalty or expulsion from NAGAAA sanctioned tournaments â€“ by fairly placing them into the division of their true caliber where they may compete against their peers.
